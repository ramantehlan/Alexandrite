# Alexandrite
**Alexandrite** is an *android app*, which saves data on the device, whether it's temporary files, downloaded app assets, user media, structured data, or something else. This app is just for *testing* **[Android Data Storage](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/index.html)** and to include all the examples for that.

# Installation
You can download the complete source code and import it in `Android Studio 2.3.3` or above version.

> Also you can just download the **[.apk](https://github.com/ramantehlan/Alexandrite/releases/latest)** file.

# Back Story

#### You probably don't want to read it

*This is my first repository on GitHub*. Basically, I decided to create Alexandrite just to implement all the methods of  **[Android Data Storage](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/index.html)**, since it was missing proper example to showcase all the methods and another reason was to simply test out file storage in Android.

#### What's in it for you

If you are new to android and want to have all the basic examples of  **[Data Storage](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/index.html)**, then this repository is for you.
