# Back Story

#### You probably don't want to read it

*This is my first repository on GitHub*. Basically, I decided to create Alexandrite just to implement all the methods of  **[Android Data Storage](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/index.html)** training section, since it was missing a full example to showcase all the methods and another reason was to simply test out file storage in Android.

#### What's in it for you

If you are new to android and want to have all the basic examples of  **[Android Data Storage](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/data-storage/index.html)**, then this repository is for you.
